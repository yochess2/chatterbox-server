# chatterbox-server
This is a redo of week 4, day 1-2 from hackreactor.

## My Recollection:
The task was to make the server side of chatterbox.  
We were NOT allowed to use express!  
I think my goal is to understand how server side works on a semi-lower level.

## Estimated Todos:
- [x] get server working.
- [x] complete stub server tests.
- [x] complete actual server tests.
- [x] limit routes to client urls.
- [ ] setup database using fs.
- [x] complete client side.
- [ ] deploy on heroku after client is completed (need fs or express).

## What I (re)learned:
- how to change git history using rebase.
- how to insert, edit, save, and quit in vim (it's been a while!)
- how to write basic tests in mocha.

## What I need to (re)learn:
- binding + this
  - I ran into rabbit holes with testing, because my memory on binding and this is weak.
